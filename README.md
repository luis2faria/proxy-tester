# Proxy Tester
Proxy tester into PHP lang using cURL to test public and private proxies
# Why you may need it?
- Crawlers
- Automation
- IA
- Etc..
# How To Use
- Into the file proxy-tester.php you have all the settings and you can change it, example if you want to change it for public proxies socks5 you can just change $selection variable for the number 4
- Important: about the variable $how_much_times is used to traverse the lines in both txt and in proxies, also all the functions count the number of the lines as you have the source code you can just automate this task or test randomly by changing only few lines
- This code creates logs of all proxies (good, bad and returned result), and also the code creates a folder "cookies" with all cookies needed for execution inside.
