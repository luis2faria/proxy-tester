# How To Use
Into the file proxy-tester.php you have all the settings and you can change it, example if you want to change it for public proxies socks5 you can just change $selection variable for the number 4
- Important: about the variable $how_much_times is used to traverse the lines in both txt and in proxies, also all the functions count the number of the lines as you have the source code you can just automate this task or test randomly by changing only few lines
